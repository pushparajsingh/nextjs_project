It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it's optimal only for its intended use of being the quickest method to fetch rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded. However, fetching data is only the beginning of what happens on a web page, which is why complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API."

It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities. The working principles of React Native are virtually identical to React except that React Native does not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM. It runs in a background process (which interprets the JavaScript written by the developers) directly on the end-device and communicates with the native platform via a serialisation, asynchronous and batched Bridge. React Native does not use HTML. Instead, messages from the JavaScript thread are used to manipulate native views."

Consequently, Node.js represents a 'JavaScript everywhere' paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.."

Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) is secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain). So, what is so special about it and why are we saying that it has industry-disrupting capabilities? The blockchain network has no central authority — it is the very definition of a democratized system. Since it is a shared and immutable ledger, the information in it is open for anyone and everyone to see. Hence, anything that is built on the blockchain is by its very nature transparent and everyone involved is accountable for their actions."

The website architecture needs to not only dove tail with your offer, but present itself in a manner that is commercial, on-brand, user-friendly and optimised for search engines. How the website looks and performs on mobile devices is increasingly a major factor in designing websites; as is how your social media sites, blogs and email campaigns interlink and look."

Shadows and other effects can be added to the layers. Photoshop actions include automation features to reduce the need for repetitive tasks. An option known as Photoshop CC (Creative Cloud) allows users to work on content from any computer. Photoshop been the industry standard image manipulation program for so long that its name has become a verb: It is common parlance to say that an image has been “photoshopped” or even just 'shopped.' Shopped, in this context, is synonymous with edited, manipulated or faked -- often regardless of the software actually used. Photoshop is used by photographers, graphic designers, video game artists, advertising and meme designers. The software is available for a monthly fee, at this writing between $9.99 and $49.99 depending on the user's requirements and options selected. Photoshop CC is compatible with Intel-based Mac computers and Windows PCs."
